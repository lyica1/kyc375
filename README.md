This is our Fall 2016 EE 319k - Introduction to Embedded Systems Final Lab Project  (Lab 10).
The Lab requires the development of a game that utilizes a minimum of 2 input switches, a slidepot, two onboard timing systems 
and animated graphics on an Sitronix ST7735 LCD monitor all onboard a TM4C123 Texas Instruments Microcontroller.

The name of our game is "Typhoon", in which the player controls a wooden sailing ship navigating through a sea filled with shipwrecks
shortly after a massive storm has taken place.

Utilized in the Lab are 4 input switches used for cardinal direction movement attached to GPIO B of the first of 2 Microcontrollers,
1 slidepot sampled by an ADC to adjust game speed and obstacle movement attached to GPIO E of the same, and finally the LCD attached to
GPIO A.  In addition to this, attached to the second Microcontroller are 2 input switches attached to GPIO E and a 6-bit DAC
attached to GPIO B.

Please judge us kindly, neither of us have ever written a program of this scale before, and I personally began to learn C 
roughly 3 months ago.
